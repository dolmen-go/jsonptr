# jsonptr - JSON Pointer ([RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)) for Go

## Features

Goals:
1. First-class interface
    * Idiomatic
    * Short
    * Complete
    * Structured errors, not just string (work in progress)
    * Working at JSON data level, not limited to serialized JSON
2. Correctness (all existing open source implementations have limitations in their interface or implementation)
    * Full testsuite (work in progress)
    * Reject invalid escapes (regexp `/~[^01]/`)
    * Allow any JSON value as leaf node
    * Allow any JSON value as root (not just a `map[string]interface{}`)
    * Allow to get/set the root of the document with the empty pointer
3. Speed (see [benchmark](https://github.com/dolmen-go/jsonptr-benchmark))

## Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/dolmen-go/jsonptr"
)

func main() {
    // JSON: { "a": [ 1 ] }
    document := map[string]interface{}{
        "a": []interface{}{
            1,
        }
    }

    val, err := jsonptr.Get(document, `/a/0`)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Got: %v\n", val)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Error: %s\n", err)
    }
}
```

## Status

This is still early work in progress.

The aim is code coverage of 100%. Use go coverage tools and consider any
code not covered by the testsuite as never tested and full of bugs.

Todo:
* tests of error cases
* `Set`: tests of array growth
* `Delete`
