## Features

1. First-class interface
2. Correctness
3. Speed (see [benchmark](https://github.com/dolmen-go/jsonptr-benchmark))

## Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/dolmen-go/jsonptr"
)

func main() {
    // JSON: { "a": [ 1 ] }
    document := map[string]interface{}{
        "a": []interface{}{
            1,
        }
    }

    val, err := jsonptr.Get(document, `/a/0`)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Got: %v\n", val)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Error: %s\n", err)
    }
}
```

## Status

This is still early work in progress.

The aim is code coverage of 100%. Use go coverage tools and consider any
code not covered by the testsuite as never tested and full of bugs.
